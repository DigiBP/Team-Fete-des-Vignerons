## Introduction


## Scenario
Simon likes cats and he travels around the world. His cat is called “Cat” and goes with him everywhere he travels. Most of the time, Cat eats, lies around, explores different environments and areas. Sometimes, Cat can be challenging. Especially, if Simon forgets to feed him. In those cases, Cat tries to get back at his owner. In particular, Cat tries to do it with tricks. Peculiarly, the cat tries to wake up him in different ways to get fed. Therefore, Cat walks aroung meowing. Cat intentionally broke a vase, so the loud smashing sound would wake Simon up, but it was not successful. Moreover, Cat climbs onto the cupboard to try to jump on Simon’s face. But suddenly the cupboard falls on Simon and hurts him. This result in several injury in Simon's face, broken bones, lengthy treatment, and long stay in the hospital. 
Simon receives the medical bill of 1 Mio. CHF which he passes to his Health Insurance. The Health Insurance “Medical Cat Health Insurance” shortened MCHI is in doubt about the invoice and requests a second opinion in Bern. CHECKMEDICAL specialises in checking medical bills for Health insurances. They disputed the invoice by different Medical Codes (e.g., ICD, DRG, Tarpy, Tarmed etc.) which were not suitable for that case in relation to the doctor’s documentation. 
Does Simon’s medical bill get paid? On what basis are the invoices rejected from Health Insurance?
