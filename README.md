## Organisational

It is hosted on Github. Contributions are made via branches. Local commits are pushed regularly. Pull requests (especially into main) have to be approved by a second person, who after approval also merges the branch.

Features and Requirements are tracked as Issues on Github.

Branch names follow the pattern: `<Issue Number>/<Title/Description of ticket in noun form with hyphens>`

Merge request names follow the pattern: `<Requirement- or Issue ID>: <Title/Description of ticket in noun form>`

Examples: Branch `2/Addition-of-Code-Styles-to-Readme` will result in the PR: `2: Addition of Code Styles to Readme`

Commits always have a commit message in the form of an action.
Example: Commit `Add commit style to Readme-file` into branch `2/Addition-of-Code-Styles-to-Readme`.
