## Scenario
Simon likes cats and he travels around the world. His cat names “Cat” gives him company in every travel. Most of the time, Cat eats, lies around, explores different environments and areas. Sometimes, Cat gives Simon hard times. Especially, if Simon forgets to feed his cat. In such cases, Cat tries to get back at his owner. In particular, Cat tries to do it with tricks. Peculiarly, the cat tries to wake up him in different ways to get fed. Therefore, Cat tries to throw meows around. Cat tries also to break a vase. The loud sound should wake up Simon, but it did not help. Moreover, she climbs onto cupboard try to jump on Simon’s face. But suddenly the cupboard falls on Simon and hurts him. This result in several injury in the face, broken bones, lengthy treatment, and long stay in the hospital. 
Simon receives doctor’s bill of 1 Mio. CHF which he passes to his Health Insurance. The Health Insurance “Medical Cat Health Insurance” shortened MCHI is in doubt about the invoice and request CHECKMEDICAL in Bern. CHECKMEDICAL is specialised in checking medical bills for Health insurances. They objected the invoice by different Medical Codes (e.g., ICD, DRG, Tarpy, Tarmed etc.) which was not suitable for that case in relation to the doctor’s documentation. 
Does Simon’s medical bill get paid? On what basis are the invoices objected from Health Insurance?
