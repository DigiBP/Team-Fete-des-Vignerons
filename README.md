# Team-Fete-des-Vignerons

## Introduction

Cat have been human companions for millenia, and their fanbase seems to be ever and ever rising, with an estimated 1.8 million living in Swiss households in 2022 (https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/283732/umfrage/katzen-in-der-schweiz/). Yet, their unpredictable stubborness, paired with fast reflexes and paws full of pointy daggers, presents a constant, potentially costly risk to friends of felines and the shhared household.

That is why Cat-Astrophy Insurances (CAI™) was founded. For a relatively low monthly fee, clients can be refunded for damages caused by their tiny tigers, be it shredded curtains (damage to property, covered 80%), single visits to the general practitioner (only one visit, and it has to be cat-related injury. Covered 50%) or medicine (20%. The two best sellers are pain killers and creams for slashed forearms. Also, per-case maxima were established for each of the three expense categories.

When applying for insurance, the insurance would send someone to the client to make sure only someone with a cat would be granted coverage. Also, it turned out that people would try to get refunds for all kinds of expenses, even non cat-related. 

Oftentimes, after the loss of a pet, people would just stop paying their monthly fees, as sending a fax posed to much of a hassle. 

All of the above was painstaking for CAI, which is why their elderly CEO, during a coke-fuled debauchery (meaning, a normal tuesday at a Swiss insurance) decided to give digitalization a try, and asked FdV (us) to set up the following processes:

 - People should be able to fill out a form, with information and the picture of their cat, and instantly be told whether they were granted insurance.
 - Through an online form, they should be able to send in a list of costs, that are checked against the maxima.
 - They should be reminded of open fees automatically, but have the possiblity to terminate the contract online.

# Assumptions

# Features

# Methodologies
The project team activated a Trello board to support agile implementation of the project. Initial brainstorming was done using design thinking techniques and literature search supported by external outreach.

## Organisational

It is hosted on Github. Contributions are made via branches. Local commits are pushed regularly. Pull requests (especially into main) have to be approved by a second person, who after approval also merges the branch.
Features and Requirements are tracked as Issues on Github.
Branch names follow the pattern: `<Issue Number>/<Title/Description of ticket in noun form with hyphens>`
Merge request names follow the pattern: `<Requirement- or Issue ID>: <Title/Description of ticket in noun form>`
Examples: Branch `2/Addition-of-Code-Styles-to-Readme` will result in the PR: `2: Addition of Code Styles to Readme`
Commits always have a commit message in the form of an action.
Example: Commit `Add commit style to Readme-file` into branch `2/Addition-of-Code-Styles-to-Readme`.

the first stages of the buyer’s journey are crucial
21% of insured persons have changed insurance providers in the last two years, especially in the automotive sector. The most important point to note here: just over half of them made this decision when it was time to renew their policy.
focus on onboarding actions to strengthen the relationship with current customers, holding them by the hand in both the initial phase and during all subsequent phases of the relationship.
